For geometry consistency, the function checks for the following, as appropriate for the specific geometry type:

Polygons have at least four points, which includes the point that closes the polygon. (The last point is the same as the first.)

Polygons are not self-crossing.

No two vertices on a line or polygon are the same.

Polygons are oriented correctly. (Exterior ring boundaries must be oriented counterclockwise, and interior ring boundaries must be oriented clockwise.)

An interior polygon ring touches the exterior polygon ring at no more than one point.

If two or more interior polygon rings are in an exterior polygon ring, the interior polygon rings touch at no more than one point.

Line strings have at least two points.

SDO_ETYPE 1-digit and 4-digit values are not mixed (that is, both used) in defining polygon ring elements.

Points on an arc are not colinear (that is, are not on a straight line) and are not the same point.

Geometries are within the specified bounds of the applicable DIMINFO column value (from the USER_SDO_GEOM_METADATA view).

LRS geometries (see Chapter 7) have three or four dimensions and a valid measure dimension position (3 or 4, depending on the number of dimensions).
